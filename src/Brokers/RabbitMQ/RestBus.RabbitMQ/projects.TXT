There are two projects in here. RestBus.RabbitMQ.csproj supports older .NET 4.5 projects while RestBus.RabbitMQ.xproj supports .NET Core.
The RestBus solution includes RestBus.RabbitMQ.xproj and nuget packages are built from RestBus.RabbitMQ.xproj.
RestBus.RabbitMQ.csproj (along with packages.config) will be removed at a later time when project.json deprecation is sorted out.
